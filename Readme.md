# Portfolio website
I'm sharpening my web development skills with this project and improving on my initial portfolio website (a separate repo). I also purposed to improve on my implementation of a figma design- didn't quite pull it off but proud of the final product nonetheless.
As usual I have employed HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
